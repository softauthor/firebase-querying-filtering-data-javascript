# Firestore Querying and Filtering Data for Web [A Complete Guide]

Understanding how queries work on the Firestore Database is one of the valuable skills to have as a Firebase Developer as Firestore is getting more popular than the Real-time database.Â 

In this Firestore tutorial,Â I will be covering how to do a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations with Firestore Database.

After that, you are going to learn how to make queries using WHERE (single/multiple), ORDERBY and LIMIT filters.

Then, I will guide you through how to get sub-collections data Collection Group queries which is one of the new features at the time of this post.

Finally, I am going to be teaching you how to split queries when you have a large collection of documents using pagination with Query Cursor function for a better experience and to save money.Â 

Sounds interesting! ðŸ˜¯... A lot to cover!

Let's get started. ðŸš€

## Add/Create A Document To Cloud Firestore
There are two ways to create/add a new document to the Cloud Firestore. Which are

- add()
- set()

Letâ€™s take a look at add() method sample code.

```
const db = firebase.firestore()
db.collection("users").add({
    name: "Anbu Selvan",
    email: "anbu.selvan@email.com",
    age: 25
})
```
To run the sample code in your project, you will need to add Firebase to your project

First, get a reference to the Firestore database using firestore() method and store it in db.

Then, obtain a reference to the users collection by invoking collection() method on the db object.

Finally,  run add() method by passing new data as a JavaScript object.
